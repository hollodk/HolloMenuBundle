Introduction
------------

This menu has 3 sections:

  - topMenu
  - topRightMenu
  - leftMenu

You can call 3 different controllers from your template:

  {% render "HolloMenuBundle:Menu:topMenu" %}

Now an events is triggered which in this case will be:

  - onTopMenuRender

Now you have to create a listener in your bundle on one of the following events:

  - onLeftMenuRender
  - onTopMenuRender
  - onTopRightMenuRender

Here is a sample of what a listener can look like:

  public function onTopMenuRender(\Hollo\MenuBundle\Event\FilterMenuEvent $event)
  {
    $menu = $event->getMenu();

    $menu['view'] = array(
      'name' => $this->translator->trans('View domains'),
      'route' => $this->router->generate('hollo_bind_admindomain_index'),
      'items' => array()
    );
  }

The rest of the magic is located in the Resources/view/Menu/topMenu.html.twig file, do whatever you have to do with this file to fit your design.
